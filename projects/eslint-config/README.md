# Eslint Config

The current linter uses the following configs:

`eslint-config-google eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-html eslint-plugin-prettier`

#### 1) Installation

In order to install this linter you need to run these commands:

`npm i eslint @ngx-chrono-ui-kit/eslint-config @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin --save-dev`

#### 2) Configuration

Then create a `.eslintrc.js` file at the root of your project containing the following content:

```
module.exports = {
  extends: '@ngx-chrono-ui-kit/eslint-config'
}
```

#### 3) Usage

Depending on your IDE, you would probably need to set it up, so it performs linting action `on save`

#### 4) Contributing

You may contribute and change the linter rules. To do so, navigate into the library folder with `cd eslint-config` and
run the command `npm publish`, it'll upload a new version into the registry with the updated version from
the `package.json`.

âš  Note that you can extend and customize the config above as shown in the
official [documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs).
